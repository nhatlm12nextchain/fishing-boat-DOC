## üìé System Functional Specifications

The fishing boat platform specifications define the following core functionality:

### üîê User Access & Security Management

The platform operates with a **dual-authentication system** serving two distinct user ecosystems:

**Customer Access Layer**
The system provides email/password authentication with security controls. The system enforces password policies, implements account lockout mechanisms after failed attempts, and maintains secure sessions through JWT tokens. The platform supports secure management of personal information and financial transactions.

**Operator Verification Process**
Boat operators undergo **approval-based onboarding** with business documentation and administrative verification. The platform validates service providers before granting trip offering capabilities. The approval workflow includes document upload, business registration verification, and manual admin review.

### üé£ Trip Discovery & Content System

**Dynamic Trip Feed**
The platform features a **content discovery engine** presenting available fishing trips through an infinite-scroll interface. Users can engage with content through likes and bookmarks. The system provides sorting mechanisms (latest vs. recommended) to surface relevant opportunities. The platform implements caching strategies to handle concurrent users while maintaining real-time availability data.

**Search & Filter Capabilities**
The platform provides **multi-dimensional filtering** functionality:

- **Temporal Filtering**: Calendar-based date selection with automatic restriction of unavailable dates and past booking deadlines
- **Geographic Targeting**: Location-based search with real-time availability counts per region
- **Species-Specific Targeting**: Dynamic filtering based on popular fishing targets, updated monthly through automated trending analysis

### üë§ Account & Profile Management

The system provides **comprehensive profile management** functionality for maintaining personal information, uploading profile images with security controls, and setting preferences that influence trip recommendations. The platform includes image processing capabilities (resizing, format validation) and secure data storage with encryption.

### üí≥ Booking & Payment Processing

**Unified Booking Experience**
The platform supports reservation completion through a **single-screen booking process** with real-time price calculations including dynamic pricing, coupons, and discount applications. The system integrates with payment gateways while maintaining PCI compliance standards and implementing retry logic for failed transactions.

**Reservation Lifecycle Management**
The platform provides booking tracking and management functionality through the complete lifecycle. The system includes status-based organization (scheduled, completed, canceled), appropriate access controls, and long-term data retention for historical tracking.

### üè¢ Administrative Operations Hub

**Vendor Approval Workflow**
The platform provides administrative functionality for **reviewing and approving operator applications**, including document verification, business credential validation, and status management. The system includes structured approval workflows with email notifications and maintains comprehensive audit trails for compliance.
