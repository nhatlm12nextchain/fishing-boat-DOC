### **User Story**

As a **user**, I want to update my profile information and upload a profile image—with cropping and validation—so that my account accurately represents my identity across platforms.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

* Users can upload a profile picture (JPG/PNG only, max size 2MB)

* Image upload supports **1:1 cropping** with live preview

* Text fields (e.g., name, bio) must sanitize input to prevent **XSS**

* Backend securely stores user metadata and encrypts sensitive fields

* JWT authentication is required to authorize updates

* All UI/UX must be fully responsive across **desktop and mobile**

* Ensure cross-browser compatibility (**Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Android, iOS**)

### **Task Breakdown**

| No. | Task Description | Role | Assigned To | Est. Hours | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Define editable fields & structure | PM | Tuong | 1.5 hrs | Align with backend schema for future extensibility |
| 2 | Design image crop & form interface | Design | Vi | 9 hrs | Includes cropping UI (1:1 ratio), error states, form layout |
| 3 | Implement frontend logic | Frontend | Khoi, Nhan | 24 hrs | Handle file upload, crop interaction, text input sanitization |
| 4 | Build backend API & logic | Backend | Cuong, Minh | 12 hrs | Encrypt fields, handle JWT, validate MIME/size |
| 5 | QA: Functional & device/browser test | QA | Nhat, Vi | 6 hrs | Manual tests across key browsers and mobile OSes |

---

### **Parallel Execution Plan (1 Working Day)**

| Block | Focus Area | Tasks | Team Members | Estimated Time |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A | PM & Design Planning | Tasks 1–2 | Tuong, Vi | \~3–4 hours combined |
| B | Frontend Implementation | Task 3 | Khoi, Nhan | Full day (split pair) |
| C | Backend Development | Task 4 | Cuong, Minh | \~5–6 hours in parallel |
| D | QA & Final Review | Task 5 | Nhat, Vi | \~2–3 hours (end of day) |

---

### **Dependencies**

* Finalized user metadata schema

* Session and JWT token handling middleware

* Image crop utility (e.g., `react-easy-crop`, `cropperjs`)

* Text and image validation (XSS, MIME type, file size)

* Optional: Auto-compression or resizing for large images

---

### **Additional Notes**

* Use battle-tested crop libraries with **mobile touch support**

* Validation must cover MIME-type, max size, and text field security (e.g., script injection)

* Frontend and backend teams should align early on **payload structure and error responses**

* Design should include fallback states for **failed uploads or network delays**

* QA must run tests on real devices to ensure cross-platform consistency
