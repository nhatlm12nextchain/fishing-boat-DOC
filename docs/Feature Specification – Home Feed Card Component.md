### **MVP Feature Specification – Home Feed Card Component (HF-CARD)**

* **Feature Name:** Feed Card Component

* **Feature ID:** HF-CARD

* **Module:** Home Feed

* **Stage:** MVP

* **Priority:** Medium

* **Status:** Scheduled

* **Target Delivery:** 4 working days

* **Estimated Total Effort:** \~111 hours

---

### **Objective**

Develop a scalable, responsive, and interactive feed card system that enables users to browse a personalized content stream with infinite scroll, real-time engagement options, and dynamic paging strategies.

---

### **User Story**

As a user, I want to scroll through a personalized feed with infinite loading and be able to interact (like or bookmark) with individual posts so that I can engage with the content that matters to me without friction.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

* **Infinite Scroll**: Seamless loading of additional feed cards with minimal latency and performance impact

* **Post Interactions**: Like and bookmark actions must reflect in real-time and persist

* **Exposure Strategy Support**: Toggle between “Latest” and “Recommended” post ordering

* **Consistent UI**: Skeleton loaders and animated placeholders during content fetch

* **Caching & Paging**:

  * Client-side cache valid for 5 minutes

  * Server-side cache TTL of 30 seconds

  * Efficient paging to reduce load and API frequency

* **Performance Handling**:

  * Graceful UI behavior under degraded network conditions

  * Debounced requests to prevent flooding

* **Cross-Device Support**: Responsive UI across mobile and desktop

* **UX Behavior**: Smooth scroll handling, predictable refresh/reset, preserve user scroll position

### **Task Breakdown**

| No. | Task Description | Role | Assigned To | Est. Hours | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Define feed logic, exposure rules, paging strategy | PM | Tuong | 3 hrs | Supports toggle between latest/recommended order |
| 2 | Design card UI, loading skeletons, and animations | Design | Vi | 15 hrs | Includes accessibility, mobile-first layout |
| 3 | Frontend Dev: UI component, infinite scroll, actions | Frontend | Khoi, Nhan | 45 hrs | Scroll tracking, feedback states, local cache |
| 4 | Backend API: paging logic, sorting, caching | Backend | Minh, Cuong | 36 hrs | Redis TTL, performance under load, ordering logic |
| 5 | QA Testing: response latency, edge cases, UX flows | QA | Nhat, Vi | 12 hrs | Stress test with bad connections, retry logic |

### **Parallel Work Plan**

| Block | Focus Area | Tasks | Team Members | Duration Estimate |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A | Feed Strategy & UI Design | Tasks 1, 2 | Tuong, Vi | 5–6 hrs |
| B | Backend Development | Task 4 | Minh, Cuong | 10–12 hrs |
| C | Frontend Development | Task 3 | Khoi, Nhan | 20–24 hrs |
| D | QA & Performance Testing | Task 5 | Nhat, Vi | 6–8 hrs |

---

### **Key Dependencies**

* Structured feed data schema (content, like/bookmark states)

* Sorting algorithm for “recommended” posts

* Local cache store (e.g., IndexedDB, in-memory)

* Redis or equivalent caching infrastructure

* Client-side scroll observer

* User session management for engagement actions

---

### **Additional Notes**

This feature’s success is highly dependent on performance and responsiveness. To meet user expectations, feed content should load seamlessly without interrupting scroll continuity. The implementation must prioritize efficient caching, reuse of components, and real-time user feedback. Accessibility standards and mobile usability must be baked into the initial MVP.

Future enhancements (e.g., filtering by tag, engagement analytics) can be built on top of this foundation with minimal refactoring.
